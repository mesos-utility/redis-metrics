[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xiam/resp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/xiam/resp)

The `resp` package provides methods for encoding and decoding data using the
[RESP][1] format.

Please note that the API of this package is not completely defined and **may
change anytime**.

## Installation

Use `go get` to instal or upgrade (`-u`) the `resp` package:

```
go get -u github.com/xiam/resp
```

## Usage

### Encoding

`resp` provides a `Marshal()` function that creates a RESP representation of a
given value.

```go
func Marshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error)
```

The following example converts the input string `"Foo"` into its [RESP][1]
representation: `$3\r\nFoo\r\n`.

```go
buf, err = resp.Marshal("Foo") // RESP: $3\r\nFoo\r\n

fmt.Printf("buf: %s\n", string(buf))
```

`resp` also provides an `resp.Encoder` type that you can use to write the
encoded message to the given `io.Writer`.

```go
w = bytes.NewBuffer(nil)

resp.NewEncoder(w)

err = w.Encode("Hello World!")

fmt.Printf("RESP: %s\n", w.Bytes())
```

### Decoding

`resp` also provides an `Unmarshal()` function that takes a RESP message and
creates a Go value with it.

```go
func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error
```

Let's take the binary safe RESP encoding of the "Foo" string (`$3\r\nFoo\r\n`),
this should be decoded into the string `"Foo"`.

```go
var dest string

err = resp.Unmarshal([]byte("$3\r\nFoo\r\n"), &dest)
```

If you want to decode a stream, you can use the `resp.Decoder` type providing
an `io.Reader`:

```go
var s string

r = bytes.NewBuffer([]byte("$3\r\nFoo\r\n"))

d = resp.NewDecoder(r)

err = d.Decode(&s)
```
